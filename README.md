## Getting Started

To run the project locally:
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Then open http://localhost:3000 in your browser.


<h2>Technical Notes</h2>

This project uses features like custom hooks and Context API for state management. The layout was built with Tailwind CSS and some features were applied with Material UI.

<h2>Areas for Improvement</h2>

One area I believe could be improved is the overall architectural design pattern. 
Since the project was built entirely from scratch, some structural compromises were inevitable. 
Also, some data fetching isnâ€™t optimized. For example, the Home Page makes extra requests even though the data is already stored on Context, which doesnâ€™t scale well.
