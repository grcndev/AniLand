## Getting Started

To run the project locally:

npm install
npm run dev
Then open http://localhost:3000 in your browser.


##Technical Notes
This project uses modern features like custom hooks, Context API for state management, and Higher-Order Components to reuse logic. 
The layout relies heavily on CSS Grid and Flexbox, even for more complex UI like hover effects.

##Areas for Improvement
One area I believe could be improved is the overall architectural design pattern. 
Since the project was built entirely from scratch, some structural compromises were inevitable. 
Also, some data fetching isnâ€™t optimized. For example, the Home Page makes extra requests even though the data is already stored in Context, which doesnâ€™t scale well.
